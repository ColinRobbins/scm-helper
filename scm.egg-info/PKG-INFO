        #
        # Installation
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/ColinRobbins/scm-helper.git
        cd scm-helper
        ```
        ## Prerequisites
        You will need Python 3.6 or greater.
        
        ## Windows
        To operate in Windows, run everything below in a PowerShell Window
        
        ## Post install
        
        Run `python3 setup.py`
        
        
        ## Configuration
        Some configuration is needed.
        The first time you run the sofware, a configuration file called `config.yaml` will be created in the `config` directory.
        You will need to modify this to configure the desired behavior.
        For full details of what can be configured see [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).
        
        ### API Key
        The first time you run `scm` you will be asked for an [API key](https://help.swimclubmanager.co.uk/portal/kb/articles/api-documentation) from Swim Club Manager, which can be found in the "Setup > Club > Club Details" menu.
        You will also be asked for a password.
        This password is used to encrypt the API Key (and also any backups).   This should be a unique password for this tool, and not on you use anywehre else (for example to logon to SCM)
        
        
        # Usage
        ```
        scm <options>
        ```
        Where...
        * **-h**
        
          Print a help message
          
        * **--analyse <date>**
        
          Run analysis on archive instead of contacting SCM.   Specify the ``date` of the backup in `yyyy-mm-dd`` format.  e.g., ``2020-04-07``.
          Also use to specify which archive to use  on ``--restore`` options.
           
        * **--backup**
           
          Create an encrypted backup of SCM.  The encrypted files are stored in the ```backups`` folder.
        
        * **--coaches*
        
          A simple report on the coaches for eash session.
          
        * **--confirm_email**
        
          A report the prints the email address of everyone that has not confirmed thier details if SCM (or they have expired)
        
        * **--csv <csv>**
        
          Read a CSV file, and compare the content with SCM.  Main use case is to compare a download of club membership records from Swim England with SCM.   You will need to edit the [configuration](docs/configuration.md) file to specify the CSV contents and checks required.
        
        * **--dump <type>**
        
          Dump SCM contents of `type` in clear text.  e.g., `scm --dump members`, or `scm -dump groups`.
          By default it will be in JSON format.  Use `--format` to specify something else.
        
        * **--error**
        
          Print issues identifed in SCM, group by error type.   This is the default behaviour of `scm` if no other parameters are supplied.
        
        * **--facebook**
        
          Check Facebook group memebrs are club members.   This is a bit tricky to set up - see [Facebook](docs/facebook.md)
        
        * **-f**
        * **-fix**
        
          Some errors can be automatically fixed.   Run `scm --fix` to fix them - you will be prompted to confirm each fix.
        
        * **--format <CSV or JSON>**
        
          The format to use with the `--dump` option.  E.g., `scm --dump lists --format CSV`
          
        
        * **-l**
        * **-lists**
        
          Creates a set of email lists in SCM, based on the search configuration defined in [configuration](docs/configuration.md).
        
        * **-m**
        * **--member**
          
          Print isses identifed grouped by member, rather an error.
        
        * **--newstarter**
        
          Include new starters in the report.  These are normally surpressed for 90 days, to allow time for everthing to be set up.
        
        * **--notes**
        
          The tools search the SCM notes field to look for details of any allowable issues for the member.  This option prints out the list of exxeptions.  See [exceptions](docs/exceptions.md) for details.
        
        * **-q**
        * **-quiet**
          
          Quiet, will not print commentary on what it is doing - useful if using `scm` in a script
        
        * **--report <report>**
        
          By default `scm` reports in everything.   You can specify specifc reports.  For example `scm --report groups`
        
        * **--restore <type>**
        
          Restore an entity of <type> from backup.   You will be asked for the name of the entry, and to confirm the restore.
          You need to specify a backup file with `--archive` as well.
          e.g., `scm -- restore member --archive 2020-03-14`
        
        * **--verify <date>**
        
          Having done a backup, you can verify it.   This will run a basic set of checks to confirm the data can be decrtpyed and read.
          (`--archive` is exactly the same!)
        
        * **--email**
        
          Send the output via email, as per configuration.   Can specify who to with `--to`
          
        * **--to <email>
        
          The email address(es) to send the email to.
          For multiple recipients, seperate them with a ';'.  No spaces.
           
        
        ### Exceptions
        Some errors you detect will be temporary.  To prevent the tools from keep repeating them add one of the following to the Notes field in the user entry in SCM:
        * API: Coach no DBS OK
        * API: Coach no Safeguard OK
        * API: Coach no sessions
        * API: Coach permission OK
        * API: no email OK
        * API: different email OK
        * API: non swimming master
        * API: no sessions OK
        * API: two groups OK
        * API: no groups OK
        
        To make this temporary, append a date. e.g., `API: no email OK (01/07/2020)`, and reporting will restart after the given date.
        
        
        # Passwords
        
        Passwords are stored encrypted.   If you need to change one, simply delete the associated '.enc' file in the config directory.
        NB:  If you have forget the password, you will not be able access the SCM backup files.
